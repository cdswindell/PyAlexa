You can throw switches, fire routes, and control engines and trains all with voice commands. The supported voice commands include:\n\nAccessories:\n  * Turn off | on accessory {tmcc_id} [for {duration}]\n  * Turn off | on track|power district {tmcc_id}\n\nRoutes:\n  * Activate | Fire | Trigger route {tmcc_id}\n\nSwitches:\n  * Throw switch {tmcc_id} [to thru | out]\n\nTrain/Engine:\n  * Accelerate/Decelerate [engine | train] {tmcc_id} to {speed step | official railroad speed} [with dialog]\n  * Blow the horn | whistle on [engine | train] {tmcc_id} [for {duration}]\n  * Boost [engine | train]  {tmcc_id}  [for {duration}]\n  * Brake [engine | train]  {tmcc_id}  [for {duration}]\n  * Enable | Disable sequence control on [engine | train] {tmcc_id}\n  * Forward | Reverse [engine | train] {tmcc_id}\n  * Open front | rear coupler of [engine | train]  {tmcc_id}\n  * Refuel [engine | train] {tmcc_id} [for {duration}]\n  * Reset [engine | train] {tmcc_id}\n  * Ring | Toggle bell on [engine | train] {tmcc_id} [for {duration}]\n  * Raise | Lower volume of [engine | train] {tmcc_id}\n  * Set the smoke level of [engine | train] {tmcc_id} to on | off | low | medium | high\n  * Start up | Shut down [engine | train]  {tmcc_id} [with dialog]\n  * Stop [engine | train] {tmcc_id}\n  * Set the momentum of [engine | train] {tmcc_id} to low | medium | high\n\nMiscellaneous\n  * Find the TMCC ID of engine {road_number}\n  * Get the status of accessory | engine | route | switch | train {tmcc_id}\n  *Emergency Halt | Halt\n\nNotes:\n  - Terms in [square brackets] are optional; [engine | train] defaults to “engine”\n  - Terms in {squiggle brackets} take specific values;\n     - {tmcc_id}: say the TMCC ID of the equipment to control (1 to 99)\n     - {duration}: say the duration to repeat the action (seconds or minutes, max of 120 seconds)\n  - Terms separated by “|” represent options\n\nMost commands have alternative forms, for example, you can say:\n  \"Accelerate  [engine | train] {tmcc_id} to {speed step | official railroad speed} [with dialog]\"  OR\n  \" Set the speed of  [engine | train] {tmcc_id} to {speed step | official railroad speed} [with dialog]\"  OR\n  \" Set speed of  [engine | train] {tmcc_id} to {speed step | official railroad speed} [with dialog]\"  OR\n  \" Speed up | Slow down [engine | train] {tmcc_id} to {speed step | official railroad speed} [with dialog]\"\n\nThe My Layout skill is powered by PyTrain. It talks with a computer on your local network running the PyTrain Api and accessible via HTTP or HTTPS.
